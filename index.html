    <h3 class="heading">▶️ Game Overview</h3>
    <p class="start-content">
      This is a two-player game based on the first 20 elements of the periodic table. If you have multiple participants,
      the game may be played with two groups.
    </p>
    

    <h3 class="heading">💡 How to Play</h3>
    <ul class="start-content">
      <li>Players take turns guessing either the correct chemical symbol for a given element name, or the correct
        element name for a given symbol.</li>
      <li>For each round, one of the 20 element-symbol pairs is randomly selected.</li>
      <li>The direction of the question (name-to-symbol or symbol-to-name) is also chosen at random.</li>
    </ul>
    

    <h3 class="heading">🔢 Scoring and Steals</h3>
    <ul class="start-content">
      <li>A correct answer earns the player <strong>1 point</strong>.</li>
      <li>If the answer is incorrect, the other player has a chance to <strong>steal</strong>. A successful steal also
        earns <strong>1 point</strong> and gives that player the next regular turn.</li>
      <li>If the steal is incorrect or goes unanswered, the game simply moves on to a new question.</li>
      <li>The game ends once all 20 element-symbol pairs have been used. The total combined score will always be exactly
        <strong>20 points</strong> since each pair is only used once and one point is awarded per pair.</li>
    </ul>
    

    <h3 class="heading">⏲️ Timing, Saving, and Resetting</h3>
    <ul class="start-content">
      <li>Each turn — including steal attempts — is timed at <strong>20 seconds</strong>. If no answer is submitted in
        time, the game proceeds to the next item.</li>
      <li>Progress is automatically saved locally. If the page is refreshed or reopened mid-game, the game resumes from
        the last turn or steal, though the timer will start at <strong>10 seconds</strong> instead of 20.</li>
      <li>A <strong>Reset</strong> button is available to restart the game at any time after all 20 items have been
        answered.</li>
      <li>A win page appears once all 20 items have been answered.</li>
    </ul>
