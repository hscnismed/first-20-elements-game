    <h1>Guess the Element!</h1>
    <p>This is a two-player game based on the first 20 elements of the periodic table. Players take turns guessing
      either the correct chemical symbol for a given element name, or the correct element name for a given
      symbol. For each round, one of the 20 name-symbol pairs is randomly selected, and the question direction
      (name-to-symbol or symbol-to-name) is also chosen at random.</p>
    <p>A correct answer earns the player 1 point. If the answer is incorrect, the other player has a chance to
      steal. A successful steal also earns 1 point and gives that player the next regular turn. If the steal is
      incorrect or goes unanswered, the game simply moves on to a new question. Missed pairs are stored and can appear
      again later.</p>
    <p>Each turn — including steal attempts — is timed at 20 seconds. If no answer is submitted in time, the game
      proceeds to the next item. The game ends once all 20 element-symbol pairs have been used. Since each pair is only
      used once, and only one point is awarded per pair, the total combined score will always be exactly 20 points.
    </p>
    <p>The game begins from a start page, so the timer and gameplay do not begin immediately upon loading or
      reloading the page. Progress is automatically saved locally. If the page is refreshed or reopened mid-game, the
      game resumes from the last turn or steal — though the timer will start at 10 seconds instead of 20. A reset
      button is available to restart the game at any time. A win screen appears once all 20 items have been
      answered.</p>
